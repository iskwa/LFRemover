This Windows application removes line breaks from text information (in English) on the clipboard.

When you run LFRemover.exe, it starts up in the task tray with a light blue icon named LR.
Press Ctrl + Shift + R to remove line breaks from text on the clipboard.

When text from a PDF document such as an article or journal is copied for machine translation, line breaks are left behind. We developed this program to successfully remove such line feeds.
